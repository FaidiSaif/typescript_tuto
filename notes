## to run a typescript file : 
1-compile it to js file ==> ts app.ts (generates an app.js file)
2-run the js file with node ==> node app.js
or both commands can be combined into one command = ts-node app.ts (without generating a compiled file )

## can i include a typescript file in index.html ? yes but this is not native
you need to install parcel bundler which parses the index.html , compiles you ts files into js files
to run the server : use parcel index.html
to install parcel : npm install -g parcel-bundler : (now you can run typescript in the browser easily)


## working with external JS libraries 
Typescript needs the types for this library :
1- types are already included with the library : ok 
2- types are not included then we need to install the type definition file related to that library
