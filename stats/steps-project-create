1 - npm init -y  // create the package.json file 
2 - tsc --init   // create the tsconfig.json file
3 - npm install nodemon concurrently 
//nodemon : s based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected
//concurrently : concurretly differnet commands 
4 - create the build and src folders 
5- tell typescript the src and the compiled files 'build' directories 
//rootDir:  './src'
//outDir : './build'
 6- configure the scrippts in package.json as the following : 
    "start:build" : "tsc -w", // run tsc en mode watch
    "start:run": "nodemon build/index.js", //re-run the index.js everytime we make a change 
    "start": "concurrently npm:start:*" // the start command runs concurrently the build and run commands
 at the biggening an erro will appear since the index.js does not exist yet, restart the server ctrl +c then npm start
